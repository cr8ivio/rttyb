# Remember That Thing You Bookmarked

RTTYB is designed to help you clearly manage those things you designated as interesting or import. Whether all your bookmarks are of cat memes ( not judging ), or you're knee deep teaching yourself to code. We all require a safe space ( This is also how I blog...cheeky ) for regular brain dumps.

No longer do **YOU** have to be an organized and realistic adult. Gain the freedom to peruse the inter webs marking everything mildly intriguing for later consumption. RTTYB will unobtrusively collect these breadcrumbs, aggregate and organize and at a later date present you with slices for guilt reducing consumption.
